1.Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client wanted us to work on their project "Draw It or Lose It". The challenge was to transform the Android based game into a web-based multiplayer game accessible on multiple platforms which; supports multiple teams and players while ensuring unique names for games, teams, and players.

2.What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The evaluation of all operating platforms particularly to their strengths and weaknesses. We covered Mac, Linux, Windows, and Mobile Devices. Server side evaluations across all platforms covered aerver-Based deployment, advantages, weaknesses, and licensing costs. Client Side evaluations covered several considerations across all paltforms such as hardware accessibility, maintenence updates, compatibility testing, cost considerations, UI design, ongoing updates, market oppourtunities, app store submission, and expertise.

3.What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design should always come before the code. Just like the unit tests should be done before the code. These design templates establish the constraints of the code and allow workflow to have an established pathing. Without these templates there would be excessive writing of code and correction of code or "washing" of code. This is not efficient. Design templates provide the structure needed for efficient production.

4.If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Although the operating platform comparison documentation is very detailed it could be a lot of information. Considering the length it is likley this can be shortened for ease of reading without losing out on the details.

5.How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user is considered in several ways. This is a web-based multi platform game. Ensuring the game runs smoothly on various web browsers and devices is key to maintaining a continuous user experience level. Having an offline functionality to handle network failures gracefully. Ensuring synchronization / Real time gameplay and latency so users do not perceive lag in any way. Scalibility, server load balancing, and server infrastructure to support a growing player base. Comprehensive security measures such as user auth, data encryption, and anti-cheat. Data storage and persistence mechanisms to save players progress and scores. Introduction of new features and maintenece with the growth of community.

6.How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
